  Abstract                 = {Summary Repair of DNA double strand breaks by homologous recombination (HR) is initiated by Rad51 filament nucleation on single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), which catalyzes strand exchange with homologous duplex DNA. BRCA2 and the Rad51 paralogs are tumor suppressors and critical mediators of Rad51. To gain insight into Rad51 paralog function, we investigated a heterodimeric Rad51 paralog complex, RFS-1/RIP-1, and uncovered the molecular basis by which Rad51 paralogs promote HR. Unlike BRCA2, which nucleates RAD-51-ssDNA filaments, RFS-1/RIP-1 binds and remodels pre-synaptic filaments to a stabilized, ��open,�� and flexible conformation, in which the ssDNA is more accessible to?nuclease digestion and RAD-51 dissociation rate?is reduced. Walker box mutations in RFS-1, which abolish filament remodeling, fail to stimulate RAD-51 strand exchange activity, demonstrating that remodeling is essential for RFS-1/RIP-1 function. We propose that Rad51 paralogs stimulate HR by remodeling the Rad51 filament, priming it for strand exchange with the template duplex.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose To investigate the effect of genetic variants in the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolic pathway and risk factors on neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in China.
Methods A total of 742 Chinese subjects, including 221 controls, 230 cases with nAMD, and 291 cases with PCV, were included in the present study. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from three genes in the HDL metabolic pathway (HDLMP) including cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), hepatic lipase (LIPC) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were genotyped in all study subjects with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). Risk factors including gender, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease were identified. Chi-square tests or Fisher��s exact tests were applied to discover associations between SNPs and risk factors for PCV and nAMD. Gene-gene interactions and gene-environment interactions were evaluated by the multifactor-dimensionality reduction (MDR) method.
Results CETP rs3764261 were significantly associated with an increased risk for PCV (odds ratio (OR) = 1.444, P = 0.0247). LIPC rs1532085 conferred an increased risk for PCV (OR = 1.393, P = 0.0094). We found no association between PCV and LPL rs12678919, LIPC rs10468017 or CETP rs173539. No association was found between five SNPs with nAMD. Regarding risk factors, females were found to have significantly decreased risks for both PCV and nAMD (P = 0.006 and 0.001, respectively). Coronary artery disease (CAD) was a risk factor in PCV patients but played a protective role in nAMD patients. Hyperlipidemia was associated with PCV but not with nAMD. Neither hypertension nor diabetes mellitus was associated with PCV or nAMD. The MDR analysis revealed that a three-locus model with rs12678919, rs1532085, and gender was the best model for nAMD, while a five-locus model consisting of rs10468017, rs3764261, rs1532085, gender, and hyperlipidemia was best for PCV.
Conclusion Our large-sample study suggested that CETP rs3764261 conferred an increased risk for PCV. We also first found the association between rs1532085 and PCV. The result of present study also showed that gender and CAD are associated with PCV and nAMD. Significant association was found between hyperlipidemia and PCV but not nAMD.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of visual impairment and legal blindness in older individuals. COL8A1 rs13095226 variants have recently been implicated associated with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy (PCV) in American studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the COL8A1 rs13095226 Polymorphism and neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in Chinese people. Methods: 900 Chinese subjects-300 cases with nAMD, 300 cases with PCV and 300 controls, were enrolled in a cross-sectional observational study. The diagnoses of nAMD and PCV were confirmed by Fundus photography, Fluorescence Fundus Angiography (FFA) and Indocyanine Green Angiography (ICGA). Genomic DNA was extracted from venous blood leukocytes and genotypes of rs13095226 were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Differences in allele distribution between cases and controls were tested by chi-square tests, with age and gender adjusted by logistic regression analysis. Result: The COL8A1 rs13095226 polymorphism was not statistically significantly different from the nAMD or PCV to the normal controls (P>0.05) in Chinese Population. The association remained insignificant after adjustmentfor age and gender differences (P>0.05). Conclusions: This case-control study indicated that the COL8A1 rs13095226 polymorphism is not associated with nAMD or PCV, which suggesting this gene maybe not a susceptibility gene locus for nAMD or PCV in Chinese subjects.},

DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 119 Chinese patients with AMD and 99 control individuals were recruited. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. Seven single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from CFH, HTRA1, RAD51, B3GALTL, TNFRSF10A and REST-C4ORF14-POLR2B-IGFBP7 were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by allele-specific restriction enzyme digestion or SNaPshot. RESULTS: Rs10483810 in RAD51 was significantly associated with advanced AMD (P=0.045). Compared with the wild-type genotype GG, the odds ratio for the risk of advanced AMD was 4.92 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-23.36) for the heterozygous TG genotype. Moreover, the GT genotype at rs10483810 confers significantly increased risk of bilateral AMD compared to unilateral AMD (OR=12.04, 95% CI: 2.50-57.69, P=0.002). Rs13278062 in TNFRSF10A, rs1713985 in REST-C4ORF14-POLR2B-IGFBP7 and rs9542236 in B3GALTL were not found to be associated with AMD (all P>0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that the risk allele T of rs10483810 in RAD51 gene is associated with an increased risk of advanced AMD, especially bilateral AMD, in Chinese population.},

  Abstract                 = {Background Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of visual impairment in individuals &gt;55 years of age worldwide. The varying clinical phenotypes of AMD result from contributions of genetic, epigenetic, and nongenetic (environmental) factors. Genetic studies of AMD have come of age as a direct result of tremendous gains from the human genome project, genome-wide association studies, and identification of numerous susceptibility loci. These findings have implicated immune response, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism, extracellular matrix, and angiogenesis signaling pathways in disease pathophysiology. Main Outcome Measures Herein, we address how the wealth of genetic findings in AMD is expected to impact the practice of medicine, providing opportunities for improved risk assessment, molecular diagnosis, preventive, and therapeutic intervention. Conclusions We propose that the potential of using genetic variants for monitoring treatment response (pharmacogenetics) may usher in a new era of personalized medicine in the clinical management of AMD.

  Abstract                 = {Despite significant progress in the identification of genetic loci for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), not all of the heritability has been explained. To identify variants which contribute to the remaining genetic susceptibility, we performed the largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies to date for advanced AMD. We imputed 6 036 699 single-nucleotide polymorphisms with the 1000 Genomes Project reference genotypes on 2594 cases and 4134 controls with follow-up replication of top signals in 5640 cases and 52 174 controls. We identified two new common susceptibility alleles, rs1999930 on 6q21-q22.3 near FRK/COL10A1 [odds ratio (OR) 0.87; P = 1.1 �� 10?8] and rs4711751 on 6p12 near VEGFA (OR 1.15; P = 8.7 �� 10?9). In addition to the two novel loci, 10 previously reported loci in ARMS2/HTRA1 (rs10490924), CFH (rs1061170, and rs1410996), CFB (rs641153), C3 (rs2230199), C2 (rs9332739), CFI (rs10033900), LIPC (rs10468017), TIMP3 (rs9621532) and CETP (rs3764261) were confirmed with genome-wide significant signals in this large study. Loci in the recently reported genes ABCA1 and COL8A1 were also detected with suggestive evidence of association with advanced AMD. The novel variants identified in this study suggest that angiogenesis (VEGFA) and extracellular collagen matrix (FRK/COL10A1) pathways contribute to the development of advanced AMD.},

To identify genetic factors that modify the risk of exudative AMD in the Japanese population, we conducted a genome-wide association study and a replication study using a total of 1,536 individuals with exudative AMD and 18,894 controls. In addition to CFH (rs800292, P = 4.23 �� 10?15) and ARMS2 (rs3750847, P = 8.67 �� 10?29) loci, we identified two new susceptibility loci for exudative AMD: TNFRSF10A-LOC389641 on chromosome 8p21 (rs13278062, combined P = 1.03 �� 10?12, odds ratio = 0.73) and REST-C4orf14-POLR2B-IGFBP7 on chromosome 4q12 (rs1713985, combined P = 2.34 �� 10?8, odds ratio = 1.30). Fine mapping revealed that rs13278062, which is known to alter TNFRSF10A transcriptional activity, had the most significant association in 8p21 region. Our results provide new insights into the pathophysiology of exudative AMD.},
